# Star-Topology Network Simulator
## Objective
This project implements a simple network simulator which can perform single-hop network traffic between a main host and additional hosts only connected to the main host. I utilized abstract classes and interfaces given by my professor to guide this project. 

## Details
- The following files were provided by my professor: FutureEventList.java, Event.java, Timer.java, Host.java
- The following files were created/implemented by me: LinkedEventList.java, Node.java, Message.java, SimpleHost.java, EventException.java, Main.java
- The following files are input files used to test/improve the simulator: simulation1.txt, simulation2.txt, simulation3.txt, simulation4.txt

## Tech Stack
- Java, IntelliJ

## Future plans
- Java GUI to display the network actions
- Implement a ring topology where each host is connected to 2 neighbor hosts: inbound and outbound.
